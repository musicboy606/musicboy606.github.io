<h2>My Profile</h2>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<img src="Profile Pic.jpg" alt="Profile Pic.jpg" width="200" height="200">

<p>My name is Jeremy Ng and my student code and email is S3873032@student.rmit.edu.au. My background is Malaysian/Chinese, I have completed part of a Bachelor of Education (Primary) course, English is my first and only language so far. <p>

<p>I think that one interesting but alarming fact about me is that I have seen around 16,000 episodes of TV and have watched almost 2000 films/movies.<p>

<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
<p>IT is something I’m interested in because it is such a huge part of our world today. I think that IT is an important skill to be knowledgeable about especially in the growing climate of the world. The cybersecurity aspect of IT is what mostly fascinates me. I started having an interest in IT when I started to be really interested in gaming and also the hardware aspect of IT.<p>

<p>I wouldn’t say there was a particular event or person that I can recall that sparked my interest. I would say that it was my gaming that got me started and then gradually YouTube videos about what was new that was coming out and all the amazing inventions people were making through IT.<p>

<p>I chose to come to RMIT online because I have heard of the university before. It also was appealing because it was a technology focused university and therefore would have a lot of knowledge to give on the subjects I was interested in.<p>

<p>I expect to learn how to effectively use technology in the world around me.<p>

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50558504?type=standout#searchRequestToken=0446c8c4-da3d-4a51-9064-4165a598b60e"> Mid-level Service Desk Technician </a>
<img src="Mid-level Service Desk Technician.jpg"
<p>This job is appealing for me because it involves helping people with problems that may arise. I work in an office role at the moment and one day would want to move into an IT support role.<p>

<p>This job involves working from remote areas away from customers and rarely onsite as well. Helping with servers and desktops. Having knowledge of cloud based infrastructure. Need to be highly knowledgeable and experienced with solutions to maintain best practice environments. <p>

<p>The skills I have at the moment are the basic skills. I am a fast learner that is always ready to help in any situation. I’m a willing participant in activities and tasks. I am a responsible and respectful worker that tries my absolute best at everything I do. <p>

<p>The way that I will obtain the skills needed to apply for this job would be to learn effectively. I am willing to put in the hard work to achieve good grades for courses I enrol in at RMIT and am looking forward to enjoying each course up until I have the necessary skills to apply for a job like the one above. <p>

<p>The results from the test don’t have much influence on me. I think that the tests results help me vaguely recognise myself, but I don’t feel like I should take them literally as it is not an individual reflection on me. The first two somewhat help me to realise my personality and what I tend to do in my life. <p>

<p>I think that the tests confirm my style of learning and working in a team. I am very much comfortable for someone to take the charge and follow their lead. The tests also show that I like to think about things in detail and make sure we are going in the right direction. In the 16 personalities test, the highest percentage was feeling. I think that was a reflection of my respect for people as other people and to always do the best I can in all situations. <p>

<p>I think when forming a team I should look for someone who is able to take charge and possibly have other people who are like me and willing to contribute. I would also look for people who are respectful and responsible. <p>

<h3>Project Idea</h3>

<p>As someone who is looking to buy a home in the next year I would love to have an app that is able to use augmented reality to effectively help homeowners to imagine what their homes could look like. It could possibly be used by stores to help remotely advise people on their purchases online. We are seeing that more and more people are willing to try online shopping especially during these tough times during the pandemic. <p>

<p>This service would effectively help customers of the furniture industry to see what their house could look like through their phone with the sellers products. This year the expected revenue for Furniture & Homeware is $2,219m USD in Australia. It could also be a worldwide product that could be used anywhere. Using this type of product easily helps the customers to get excited and motivate customers to go in store and buy. <p>

<p>The product would first need to visually measure the dimensions of the room by visual calculation. There is a good app that has been developed that is able to visually measure distances through the use of a phone camera. The product would utilise this type of technology to measure the diagrams of a room. Once this was done the user would be able to change the dimensions if they were incorrect as well. <p>

<p>The next part of the app would be the actual augmented reality that is able to place and move things around the room. The app would have to use location tracking so that the user would be able to move around the room and the objects would stay in place. <p>

<p>This product would have generic selections of furniture that you could place in an empty room/space. We would research and have a look at many different furniture to create our own digitally created furniture. We would also create general categories like bedroom and living room to help the user to efficiently pick what furniture they might like in their selected space. Ideally the user would be able to place a selection of furniture and be able to move around the room safely and see what the furniture looks like from that different location. <p>

<p>The app would hopefully be able to connect with furniture & homeware brands that would be able to fully utilise this technology. It would link with the brands and they would supply the product with dimensions and possibly their own developed models of the furniture they were selling. This would be translated in the app and the user would be able to integrate new furniture in a room with old furniture. <p>

<p>The app would have to be developed through software engineers and business consultants. Ideally the business consultants would be from the background of furniture and homeware to effectively market for the right companies/people. The hardware needed would be multiple phone systems to make sure it was compatible with all smartphones. Software would be needed for the creation of the app. <p>

<p>The skills required to create the app would be software engineers. It would be important for one of the software engineers to have a reasonable amount of experience in VR or augmented reality to lead the development of the app. On average a VR app would take about 3-6 months to develop and prototype. This is a significant amount of time to set aside with no foreseeable profit. <p>

 <p>If this was a successful project then the outcome would be some brands seeing the potential for the app and integrating their products into the app. This development would mean that the app would need a lot of attention especially if working for brands that are based in different countries. The teams might be individual for each brand to maximise productivity and continuity.<p>
